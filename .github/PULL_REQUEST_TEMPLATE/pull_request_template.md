## PR Creator Checklist

- [ ] I gave a proper description summary.
- [ ] My PR is less time-consuming to review. i.e.
  EITHER it is a short PR and contains one unit of functionality.
  OR it is a refactor and thus even though touches more files but is still easy to review and less time-consuming.
- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my PR.
- [ ] I formatted my code before pushing (since plugins wouldn't help much with unnecessary empty lines).
- [ ] I clicked on the button "*squash and merge automatically*", to avoid my PR hanging there for too long after necessary approvals and build checks are completed.
- [ ] If there are any comments on my PR for change, I will provide an update for all of those comments (either fix-and-pushed, or provide information without any changes pushed). In any case, I will let the person who raise a review comment (reviewer), resolve them - and not myself.
  > Some tips for PR Creator:
  The person creating PR can either, first make a fix, push the change and then comment that it is “fixed - pushed” rather than saying “will do”. OR give a reason why you think you would like to keep the same solution without making a change. The reviewer can then either accept the answer and resolve comment or initiate a one on one discussion with a creator and come to a  conclusion.

## PR Reviewer Checklist

- [ ] I will be respectful while giving the feedback.
- [ ] I will remember to keep my feedback constructive and give feedback on the code; not the person.
- [ ] I will also remember to compliment my peers when they do something good in the PR.
- [ ] While giving feedback for improvement, I will also try to give some good references. Such as from [clean code](https://moderatemisbehaviour.github.io/clean-code-smells-and-heuristics/)
  or official documentation/references.
- [ ] If I don’t expect action on a comment, I will make it clear to the reader that it is only for curiosity and not for action.
- [ ] If I find that the PR was huge, unless it was a one area refactor PR, I will respectfully ask the author to break it into smaller PRs and reject the PR.
- [ ] If the change for a particular area in review is too big to be handled in a PR, I will ask PR creator to create a Jira ticket for it, and add a Todo in the code. Once the PR creator has done this, I can accept the PR.
