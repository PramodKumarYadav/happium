Uninstalling appium-desktop
Chocolatey v0.11.1
Uninstalling the following packages:
appium-desktop
appium-desktop is not installed. Cannot uninstall a non-existent package.

Chocolatey uninstalled 0/1 packages. 1 packages failed.
 See the log for details (C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\logs\chocolatey.log).

Failures
 - appium-desktop - appium-desktop is not installed. Cannot uninstall a non-existent package.

If a package uninstall is failing and/or you've already uninstalled the
 software outside of Chocolatey, you can attempt to run the command
 with `-n` to skip running a chocolateyUninstall script, additionally
 adding `--skip-autouninstaller` to skip an attempt to automatically
 remove system-installed software. Only the packaging files are removed
 and not things like software installed to Programs and Features.

If a package is failing because it is a dependency of another package
 or packages, then you may first need to consider if it needs to be
 removed as packages have dependencies for a reason. If
 you decide that you still want to remove it, head into
 `$env:ChocolateyInstall\lib` and find the package folder you want to
 be removed. Then delete the folder for the package. You should use
 this option only as a last resort.
