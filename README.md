An open source **production ready** test framework on Appium, the core of which is **directly reusable** in your project with minimum configuration changes.

Framework uses **Junit5** and provides **4 different modes of running your tests in parallel** on a **local machine**, and a **clean design**, with **clear separation of concerns**, that results in **high readability** and **low maintenance**; all in all a **pleasure to work with**! 

> P.S: And yes, this probably maybe the only framework on the internet that provides 4 modes of execution using 
junit5 on localhost (there are examples to run on browsertack and saucelabs but on localhost this is 
the first - atleast I couldnt find another one). And it is only going to get better from here, so stay tuned!

# Key features
- **A clean design** with clear separation of concerns
- **4 local parallel modes of execution**
    - [x] CLASS_SERIES_TEST_SERIES,
    - [x] CLASS_SERIES_TEST_PARALLEL,
    - [x] CLASS_PARALLEL_TEST_SERIES,
    - [x] CLASS_PARALLEL_TEST_PARALLEL
- **Readable tests** that separates test intentions from test implementation. 
- **Screen object model** based on page object model, to design and write screen classes. 
- **Easy maintenance** and **scalability** is what **happium** offers!

##  Objectives
- [x] Atomic independent tests
- [x] Core framework to be fully plug and play. Just change configuration as per your app and write domain and tests as per your app.
- [x] Four different modes of execution - just by selecting a config option.
    - [x] serial (all tests) - preferred mode when you want to test/debug a particular device.
    - [x] parallel ( all Test Classes and within each test class, run in serial). Preferred mode for running tests in CI.
    - [x] parallel ( all Test cases with a Class but all Test classes in series (one after another). - Preferred mode when building new tests for a test class and testing if all tests can run in parallel without issues before pushing them to GitHub.
    - [x] parallel ( all Test Classes and within each test class, all tests also run in parallel) - a total beast mode if your machine can handle it - that is :-).
- [x] A very clean design with very high separation of concerns.
    - [x] This means every entity is highly readable, maintainable and scale able.
    - [x] Tests, app, data, config, domain, framework entities, everything is well separated and results in near zero duplication anywhere.
- [x] Framework design allows you to write highly readable tests.
    - [x] So tests read like reading english (with test intentions rather than implementation logic).
    - [x] Tip: Take examples as a guide and Use page object model to write your screen entities and separate test intentions from screen implementation to write readable tests.
- [x] With time, to add more common methods that will build a library of actions that will bring stability and capabilities to what you can do on your screens/ apps.
- [x] Deep linking examples to show how you can speed up your test execution
    - [x] Skip login and show how application *state* can be set using deeplinks to test a particular screen; instead of logging in every time.
    - [x] Login is the only class where we should test all login scenarios. For testing other screens heavily use deeplinks (if you can).
    - [x] Note: You should have a very few end to end scenarios that involves actual end to end flows via login and user interactions.
- [X] How to install Appium on windows with an automated script (avoid manual setup)
  Use happium for **appium** and be happy automating mobile apps!

## Working principles
There are two key principles you will see throughout being followed in the project. 
- **For tests**: I will follow the principle of `seperating test intentions from test implementation`. Meaning, you will only see test intentions in the tests without any code implementation details in tests. 
> This results in highly readable `tests`, with low/zero code duplication. 
- **For code**: I will follow `seperation of concerns` principles. Broadly this means keeping code, config and data seperate. More importantly you will see this principle followed heavily within code to create classes and functions that follow clean code principles and are thus highly readable and easily maintainable.
> This results in highly readable `code` with no code duplication.

## Working approach
When I learn a new tool or technology, my working approach is to `first make it work` and `then make it better`. Thus refactoring is a `way of life` in all my projects. Following the scout and guides principle that if you touch a class, you have to `leave code cleaner than you found it`. Eventually this approach would result in the code that looks like what I mentioned before in the working principles.   

## Installation (dependencies and appium)
- For windows setup: Go to install folder in root directory. Now refer powershell script named `Install-AppiumOnWindows.psm1`
- To do a full setup on Windows; execute below commands.

```
- cd to this project. Say (cd D:\happium\)
- Import-Module .\install\Install-AppiumOnWindows.psm1 -Force
- Install-AppiumDependencies
- close this terminal. Check that you have node properly installed and available using npm -v and node -v commands. If you see versions, then run:
- Install-Appium 

P.S: To install any dependency that may have not properly installed in previous step. Close the current terminal. Open a new one as administrator and now run the function name. 
For example to only install appium-doctor, run on terminal.
- Install-AppiumDoctor
```
#Setup
-[X] Clone the sample apps repository and get some apps for testing.
    - Run git clone https://github.com/appium/sample-apps.git (to get 3 apk apps). Use "ContactManager.apk" from this list. Put it in apps folder.
    - npm install sample-apps (to install all the apps)
-[] Now we have the app. Let's create a driver factory that will give us a emulator for any avd that we ask for.

## Troubleshooting tips
- 1) It seems when I start appium server from *appium-desktop*, there are lesser issues with running avds from tests in parallel/or stand alone. 
     
    - [ ] So to avoid issues, always launch *appium-desktop* unless you find a stable fix for launching from appium terminal. 
      
    Launching appium server from terminal, works sometimes and not on other times. The error I see most often when running tests from appium terminal is while 
    making a call to pixelratio endpoint: GET http://127.0.0.1:8201/wd/hub/session/16cc5cc1-9507-4d03-9282-1e8bded63c3c/appium/device/pixel_ratio

- 2) Also it seems, Appium-desktop is only able to open the images created by android-studio (say Pixel_XL_API_31.avd). 
     If you have created an image by avd (say Pixel_5_API_31.avd), it seems appium-desktop keep throwing different kind of errors and cannot create a session. 
    - [ ] So create avd devices using android studio
- 3) If you want to launch emulator from tests. 
      - *One*, you must use an image created by *android studio* (say Pixel_XL_API_31.avd). Giving another image not created from studio (say Pixel_5_API_31.avd) will fail. 
      - *Two*, You must give the absolute path of the app. 
        Note that when the emulator is started manually via the android studio, then you can even give a relative path and tests works. 
        However, if you want to launch emulator and app from the tests, then you have to take care of both above points (Absolute path and an app created via android studio)
