# happium ðŸ˜Š
Goal of this project is to provide new Appium users with a reference framework that they can use to create production grade,
cross platform, mobile app tests.

End result should be a clean, readable and maintainable framework; the core of which you should be able to port to your actual project as is, and start writing tests from there. 

## Working principles
There are two key principles you will see throughout being followed in the project. 
- **For tests**: I will follow the principle of `seperating test intentions from test implementation`. Meaning, you will only see test intentions in the tests without any code implementation details in tests. 
> This results in highly readable `tests`, with low/zero code duplication. 
- **For code**: I will follow `seperation of concerns` principles. Broadly this means keeping code, config and data seperate. More importantly you will see this principle followed heavily within code to create classes and functions that follow clean code principles and are thus highly readable and easily maintainable.
> This results in highly readable `code` with no code duplication.

## Working approach
When I learn a new tool or technology, my working approach is to `first make it work` and `then make it better`. Thus refactoring is a `way of life` in all my projects. Following the scout and guides principle that if you touch a class, you have to `leave code cleaner than you found it`. Eventually this approach would result in the code that looks like what I mentioned before in the working principles.   

## Installation (dependencies and appium)
- For windows setup: Go to install folder in root directory. Now refer powershell script named `Install-AppiumOnWindows.psm1`
- To do a full setup on Windows; execute below commands.

```
- cd to this project. Say (cd D:\happium\)
- Import-Module .\install\Install-AppiumOnWindows.psm1 -Force
- Install-AppiumDependencies
- close this terminal. Check that you have node properly installed and available using npm -v and node -v commands. If you see versions, then run:
- Install-Appium 

P.S: To install any dependency that may have not properly installed in previous step. Close the current terminal. Open a new one as administrator and now run the function name. 
For example to only install appium-doctor, run on terminal.
- Install-AppiumDoctor
```
#Setup
-[X] Clone the sample apps repository and get some apps for testing.
    - Run git clone https://github.com/appium/sample-apps.git (to get 3 apk apps). Use "ContactManager.apk" from this list. Put it in apps folder.
    - npm install sample-apps (to install all the apps)
-[] Now we have the app. Let's create a driver factory that will give us a emulator for any avd that we ask for. 

## Reference
-[Sample apps to use for testing](https://github.com/appium/sample-apps)

## Troubleshooting tips
- 1) It seems when I start appium server from *appium-desktop*, there are lesser issues with running avds from tests in parallel/or stand alone. 
     
    - [ ] So to avoid issues, always launch *appium-desktop* unless you find a stable fix for launching from appium terminal. 
      
    Launching appium server from terminal, works sometimes and not on other times. The error I see most often when running tests from appium terminal is while 
    making a call to pixelratio endpoint: GET http://127.0.0.1:8201/wd/hub/session/16cc5cc1-9507-4d03-9282-1e8bded63c3c/appium/device/pixel_ratio

- 2) Also it seems, Appium-desktop is only able to open the images created by android-studio (say Pixel_XL_API_31.avd). 
     If you have created an image by avd (say Pixel_5_API_31.avd), it seems appium-desktop keep throwing different kind of errors and cannot create a session. 
    - [ ] So create avd devices using android studio
- 3) If you want to launch emulator from tests. 
      - *One*, you must use an image created by *android studio* (say Pixel_XL_API_31.avd). Giving another image not created from studio (say Pixel_5_API_31.avd) will fail. 
      - *Two*, You must give the absolute path of the app. 
        Note that when the emulator is started manually via the android studio, then you can even give a relative path and tests works. 
        However, if you want to launch emulator and app from the tests, then you have to take care of both above points (Absolute path and an app created via android studio)
